## Problem 1: Array Max Result

#### Instructions
Given an array and a number, output the computated "score". The method you create should take in
both an array of integers and the integer the user selected.

#### Selection and Scoring Algorithm
Any number may be selected, however your scoring will be depend on the frequency of that number in the list. 
E.g for [2,2,3,5,4] if you pick 2 your score will be 4 (2 * 2) but if you pick 5 your score will be 5 (5 * 1).

#### Input Format
An array of integers, and the number chosen.

#### Sample Input
[6,4,4,1,3] , 4

#### Sample Output
8
